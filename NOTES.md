## Architecture

The project is built in such a way that it would be easy to scale in any direction.  
The idea is to separate all features into modules (registration, home) and separating pages into sub modules.  
Also tried to separate smart/dumb components.

## Testing

Testing could be done in a more extensive way, but I didn't feel the need in such low risk features.  

## CI/CD

It was not part of the assignment but it's essential for product readiness. I wanted to mention it.
